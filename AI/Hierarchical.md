>A planning approach that involves organising tasks and actions in multiple levels of abstraction and hierarchy.

- High Level Task(Ultimate Goal) -> \[... , Sub Goals (Actions)]
- DAG
	- Root - Goal state
	- Leaves - Actions

### Components
1. High Level Goals
2. Task decomposition
3. Planning Hierarchy
4. Plan generation at different levels
5. Plan Synthesis
6. Plan Execution
7. Plan Adaptation

### Advantages
1. Scalability
2. Abstraction and Reuse
3. Flexibility
4. Higher-Level reasoning
### Challenges
1. Scalability
2. Complexity
3. Difficulty in handling dynamic environments  
### Techniques
- **Decomposition**
	1. Goal
	2. Task Network
	3. State-based
- **Abstraction**
	1. State
	2. Action
	3. Temporal
- **Task Allocation**
	1. Centralized
	2. Decentralized
	3. Market-Based
- **Plan Integration**
	1. Plan merging
	2. Plan refinement
	3. Plan composition
